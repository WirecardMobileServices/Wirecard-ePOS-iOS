/*
 
 Note: The following test is an example of a how to use ERP/SAP queries. For them to work, you need to have
 ERP enabled in backend side, and actual data such as catalogue, members, products, etc. linked to your account.
 Responses coming from external systems can generate unexpected results, so make sure to have correct data
 already defined.
 
 The ERP features compatible with the accept SDK includes:
    - The ability to search for a Member ID, name or surname. Exact matched will return the member you are looking for,
    and aproximate sarch will return an array of the matches (ie for displaying them in a dynamic search table)
    - The ability to request special prices for an array of products ID, that will return discount prices if a member ID has that privilege.
    - The ability to request stock for an array of products in a single shop, or for a single product in all merchant's shops.
