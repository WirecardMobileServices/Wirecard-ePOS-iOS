             WDResultStatusOK indicates the process ended with OK status.
             WDResultStatusPasswordCriteriaNotMet - in the case of changing the password indicates that the new password does not meet the criteria.
             WDResultStatusPasswordValidationFailure - in the case of changing password indicates the password validation failure old and new password mismatch.
             
             Note that result.detail will tell you what may have failed, including incorrect current password, password criteria not met, etc.
             The password policy can be requested using sdk.userManager.passwordPolicy, so you can use this criteria in your UI, and even for validating the strings yourself, though this is necessary as you will get a validation result in completion anyways.
